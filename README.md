## How to run and build project:

For a successful build, you need to import into the $root of the project directory "properties" folder, which contains all JKS(dev/prod) and "secrets.properties" which you will need for the build.  
Please do not commit "properties" folder into GIT ❌ or cover it with [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt).
